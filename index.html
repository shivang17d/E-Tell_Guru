              <h1>Story</h1>
              <p>Once upon a time, in a big jungle, there was a strong lion. Every day, the lion took a nap under a huge
                tree.
                One sunny day, a little mouse saw the lion and wanted to play. The mouse thought the lion's fluffy mane
                looked fun, so he hopped onto the lion's head. But, oh no! This made the lion wake up and feel grumpy.
                The
                lion caught the mouse and was about to scold him.

                The mouse was scared and begged the lion not to hurt him. He promised to help the lion one day if he was
                spared. Surprisingly, the lion laughed and decided to let the mouse go.

                Another day, the lion got trapped in a net while walking. He tried very hard to escape but couldnâ€™t. He
                called for help, and guess who heard him? Yes, it was the little mouse! The brave mouse quickly chewed
                through the net, freeing the lion.

                The lion was so grateful! He realized that even small friends can be very helpful. Since that day, the
                lion
                and the mouse became the best of friends, always helping each other.</p>
